## Next Version

## 0.1

- Initial release for Chrome and Microsoft Edge, adding per-query enhancements to hosted Azure
  DevOps at `dev.azure.com` and `*.visualstudio.com`, with synced query bindings, top-bar controls,
  and session-only switching between AwesomeADO and the standard view.
- Introduces the Project Tracking board: a theme-aware hierarchical view with sprint, area path,
  Feature Crew, recent activity, and blocker filters; configurable ordering; refresh; and compact
  child rollups.
- Supports inline work-item updates for status, priority, assignee, ETA, sprint, area path, title,
  description, and blocker markers, plus drag-and-drop ordering and hierarchy changes with
  conflict-aware Azure DevOps writes.
- Displays and edits Azure DevOps discussions and descriptions with sanitized rich text,
  screenshots, Markdown shortcuts, `@`-mentions, and a maximizable View all notes surface.
- Adds Azure DevOps configuration for teams, areas, work-item mappings and hierarchy, ETA fields,
  marker tags, sprint windows, and per-query Project Tracking behavior.
- Provides Dark, Light, and Blue themes, plus Follow Azure DevOps, consistently across options,
  enhanced views, menus, controls, and status indicators, including live Dark and Light updates when
  following Azure DevOps.
- Supports configuration import/export and team sharing through an Azure DevOps work item, with
  automatic pulls and explicit conflict-aware publishing.
- Includes a device-local Diagnostics log with source and error filtering that keeps query names and
  customer data out of exported diagnostics.
